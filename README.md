# Javascript-template-Literals

`Template literals` use backticks  ` `` ` and not quotes `("...")` to create a string;

It allows for one to use various punctuation marks and reference variable values in the string with ease.

```
const name = "Themba";

const preferredName = "Mthimbana";

const message = `His name is "${name}", but he prefers to be called "${preferredName}".`;

console.log(message);
///Will print:
His name is "Themba", but he prefers to be called "Mthimbana".
```
